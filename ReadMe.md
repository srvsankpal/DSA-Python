### Linked List
- Every element/node of linked list is a individual object of a class which has an attribute next that points towards the object of next element. Initially it points to none but as we append elements it points to the next.
- Every Linked list has an attribute head which is the first element.
- To append an element we have to loop through the head till the last element as unlike a normal list there is no absolute position for each element.
- More methods other than what I have written can be defined for a linked list.
